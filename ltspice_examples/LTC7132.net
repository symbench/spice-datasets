* Please read the following notes carefully since the model behaves differently from the user \ninterface for the LTC7132.\n \n(1) PMBus communication and memory address related functions and pins are not modeled.\n \n(2) Changes to parameter values while the simulation is running will not take effect unless the\nsimulation is stopped and restarted. This is different from the way the part operates which will\nrespond to the changes while running.  \n \n(3) Share_clk is not modeled. The default time reference of LTspice is used as the common time \nbase for all time-related parameters.\n \n(4)The following parameters can be defined by right-clicking on the LTC7132 symbol.\nThe nomenclature used here differs from the one in the data sheet. If any value of these parameters is\nset beyond the scope described in the data sheet, the resulting simulation will not be meaningful.\n \n     VIN_ON & VIN_OFF -- in volts, set the unit start/stop input voltages; \n     Freq -- in Hz, sets switching frequency as one of values of 250k, 350k, 425k, 500k, 575k, 650k, \n                 750k,1000k. Freq_cfg pin needs to float or short to VDD25, to make the value be in effect;\n     PHs_0 & PHs_1 -- in degree, set phase angle related to SYNC signal. \n                Certain combinations are restricted as in data sheet. Phase_cfg pin needs to float or \n                short to VDD25, to make the value be in effect;  \n     Ton0_delay & Ton0_rise; Ton1_delay & Ton1_rise -- in sec, set delay and soft-start timers for \n                channel0 and channel1. Initialization time is not modeled; \n     Toff0_delay & Toff0_fall; Toff1_delay & Toff1_fall -- in sec, set delay and soft-off timers for \n                channel0 and channel1;\n     Vout_0 & Vout_1 -- in volt, set output voltages respectively. Vout_cfgn pin needs to float or \n                short to VDD25, to make the value be in effect;\n     Vout0_range & Vout1_range -- set maximum output range, with value 0\n                for 4.096V (CH0) and 5.5V (CH1), value 1 for 2.75V;\n     Ilim0_range & Ilim1_range -- set maximum sensed peak current range, with value 0\n               for low (45.14mV), and 1 for high (81.25mV);\n     OC_limit0 & OC_limit1 -- set ratio of peak current limit to the maximum value defined by Ilimit_range. \n               It must be one of values: 0.5, 0.572, 0.642, 0.714, 0.786, 0.858, 0.928, 1;\n     Mode_II -- sets light load operation mode: 0 for discontinuous, 1 for forced continuous;\n     Fault_response -- sets the response mode of the LTC7132 to occuring faults:\n              0 for ignore, 1 for latch up, 2 for Hiccup after Retry_delay time;\n     Retry_delay -- in sec, sets the timer before the LTC7132 turns on after a fault;\n     gm -- transconductance of the error amplifier. It must be between 1m mho and 5.73m mho;\n     Rth -- Compensation resistor. It must be set between 0k ohms and 62k ohms;\n     LowDCR -- set to 1 if DCR is below 1m ohm and make RC = L/(5*DCR), set to 0 if DCR is above \n               1m ohm and make RC = L/DCR.
