* OV/UV Test Jig\n \nThis circuit tests the LT4365's behavior with "normal" Overvoltage and Undervoltage\nconditions.  The part is configured to pass 12V nominally, down to 3V and up to 18V,\nthe same typical automotive application in the datasheet.\n \nV(in) is driven to 12V and held until the part turns on and stabilizes.  \nV(in) is then driven below 3V to test the Undervoltage lockout, then below 2.5V\nto test the miniumum voltage threshold.\nV(in) is returned to 12V and held until the part is on and stable again.\nV(in) is driven above 18V to test the Overvoltage lockout.\nFinally, V(in) is returned to 12V and held until the part turns on and stabilizes again.
