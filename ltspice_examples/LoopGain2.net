* Here the open loop gain is determined from the closed loop system[1].\nThe open loop gain can be plotted by plotting the quantity:\n \n-1/(1-1/(2*(I(Vi)@1*V(x)@2-V(x)@1*I(Vi)@2)+V(x)@1+I(Vi)@2))\n \nAlternatively, you add the following line to your plot.defs file:\n.func T.et.al() -1/(1-1/(2*(I(Vi)@1*V(x)@2-V(x)@1*I(Vi)@2)+V(x)@1+I(Vi)@2))\nAnd then plot simply T.et.al()\n \nThis is an improvement over the technique shown in LoopGain.asc \nbecause it (i) accounts for reverse feedback(it doesn't even\nmatter if you reverse the direction of the probe -- you still compute\nthe same open loop response) and (ii) the inserted probe elements\nresult in a smaller, sparser circuit matrix.
