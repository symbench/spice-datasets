* *Equivalent to 6ft #22 wire.  Voltage drop across \nRwire & Rwire2 adds to minimum input voltage requirement.  \nLTC recommends that voltage loss in the wires be < 20% of Vout.\n \n** Actual inductance will vary with cable construction\nbut other circuit values will normally remain the same.

* The LT3086 model breaks new ground by simulating thermal conditions on the die.  \nIt uses a two-stage thermal model to simulate both package & heat sink thermal conditions.  \nThe default values are for an FE package on a moderate size board with thermal vias to internal planes, \ngiving an overall thermal resistance of 21°C/W.  Package resistance is modeled with Rpkg = 14°C/W, \nand a time constant, Tpkg = 10s.  Heat sink (PC board) is modeled with Rsink = 7°C/W and Tsink = 250s.   \nThese numbers can be edited by the user by right clicking on the 3086 symbol.  \n \nThe included chart shows typical values for each package.  Die temperature is accessed by clicking \non the 3086 Temp pin, which is scaled at 10mV/°C, giving 500mV at 50°C.  Keep in mind that when \nyou do DC sweeps, die temperature is at t -> infinite, and that the model does not attempt to change \nparameters as a function of temperature.  It is still the users responsibility to use datasheet \nspecifications as the final determiner of correct part usage.
