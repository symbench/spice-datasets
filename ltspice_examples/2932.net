* Transient Duration vs Comparator Overdrive (V1, V2) Test Jig\nThis circuit is for injecting variable lenght and duration pulses that are\nbelow the typical 5V comparator threshold on V1.  The actual threshold here\nhas been found to be about 4.6557V.  \n \nTo measure the transient duration before _RST is asserted a below threshold\npulse is driven into V1 and the time between that falling edge and the falling /RST\nedge is measured.
