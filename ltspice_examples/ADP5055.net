* Please read the following notes carefully, as the model presents different user interface from\nthe real part does.\n \n(1) All PMBus communication and memory address related functions and pins are not modeled. \n \n(2) Changes to all parameter values during the simulation running will not be in effect, unless the\nsimulation is stopped and restarted. This is different from the operation of the part, which will\n respond to the commanded changes while running. \n \n(3) The sequence control on each channel is not modeled. \n \n(4) The following parameters can be defined, by right-clicking the symbol of ADP5055.If any value \nof these parameters are set beyond the scope discribed in the datasheet, the resulting simulation\noutcomes are not meaningful.\n \nVref1, Vref2 and Vref3: set the reference voltage of channal1, channel2 and channel3 respectively\n \nFT1, FT2 and FT3: set the Fast Enhanced Transient Mode for channal1, channel2 and channel3 respectively \n0 for Fast Enhanced Transient Mode disabled\n1 for 1.5% window with 3x Gm \n2 for 1.5% window with 5x Gm\n3 for 2.5% window with 5x Gm
