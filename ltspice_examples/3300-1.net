* Note: 1. Serial Interface features are not modeled. Parameters, Bal_Act_0n, are introduced to command \n              each cell balancing action: 0- No balance; 1- Nonsync discharge; 2- Sync discharge; 3- charge\n          2. Single transformer feature is not modeled.\n          3. The model is capable of multi-chip stack operation, even though daisy chain connection of \n              serial ports are not available.\n          4. Watchdog timer is not modeled.
