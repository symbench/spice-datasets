.tran 500u startup
.softstart .2 ; This option reduces the internal softstart time by 5x.
* This model simulates two channels of ADP5014\nFeatures configured by the CFG1 and CFG2 pins are controlled\nby features of the IC found by Ctrl right click.\n--CL is current limit and and can be set to 6.9 for 4 A,\n  or 3.5 for  2 A.  It is also a good to simulate startup using the minimum values\n --Paralllel should be set to 1 if using channels in parallel, else 0\n--Timer should be set to 1 or 8 depending on the length hiccup required\n--PSM should be 0 for forced PWM and 1 for PSM (low power pulse\n   skip mode) enabled\n--Outputs of the GPIO pin are pinned out seperately for your convenience\n--Enable mode is always manual mode\n--See the datasheet to configure channels for parallelt operation
