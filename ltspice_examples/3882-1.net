* Please read the following notes carefully, since the model presents different user interface\nthan the real part does.\n \n(1) All PMBus communication and memory address related functions and pins are not modeled. \n \n(2) Changes to all parameter values during the simulation running will not be in effect, unless the\nsimulation is stopped and restarted. This is different from the operation of the part, which will\n respond to the commanded changes while running. \n \n(3) Share_clk is not modeled. The default time reference of LTspice is used as the common time \nbase for all time related parameters.\n \n(4) The following parameters can be defined, by right-clicking the symbol of LTC3882. Different \nnomenclature from the datasheet is adopted here. If any value of these parameters are set beyond \nthe scope discribed in the datasheet, the resulting simulation outcomes are not meaningful.\n \n    Freq -- in Hz, sets switching frequency as one of values of 250K, 300K, 350K, \n                400K, 450K, 500K, 600K, 750K, 900K, 1000K, 1250K. FREQ_CFG pin needs to float \n                (or short to VDD25), to make the value be in effect;\n     PHAS_0 & PHAS_1 -- in degree,  set phase angle related to SYNC signal. \n                Certain combinations are restricted as in datasheet. PHAS_CFG \n                pin needs to float (or short to VDD25), to make the value be in effect;\n     Ton0_delay & Ton0_rise; Ton1_delay & Ton1_rise -- in sec, set delay and soft-start timers for \n                channel0 and channel1. Initialization time is not modeled;\n     Toff0_delay & Toff0_fall; Toff1_delay & Toff1_fall -- in sec, set delay and soft-off timers for \n                channel0 and channel1;\n     Vout_0 & Vout_1 -- in volt, set output voltages respectively. Vout#_CFG pin needs to float \n                (or short to VDD25), to make the value be in effect;\n     Vout0_range & Vout1_range -- set maximum output range, with value 0\n                                                      for 5.5V; value 1 for 2.75V;\n     Iout0_fault & Iout1_fault -- in Amper, set maximum inductor peak current value, OC will be triggered \n                                               when the value is exceeded;\n     Iout0_warn & Iout1_warn -- in aMper, set the average load current maximum value, which will be used  \n                                                with Vout#_AVP to define the AVP operation;\n     Iout0_gain & Iout1_gain -- in Ohm, set sensing resistor or inductor DCR values used in the circuit;\n     Vout0_AVP & Vout1_AVP -- set the maximum value reference will reduce at Iout#_warn level:
