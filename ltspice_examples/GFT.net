* This example schematic is supplied for informational/educational purposes only.\nWe thank Frank Wiedmann for contributing this example.
* This example shows how to simulate the quantities of the General Feedback Theorem, which are defined in the article\n R. David Middlebrook, "The General Feedback Theorem: A Final Solution for Feedback Systems", IEEE Microwave Magazine, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 50-63, April 2006.\nThis article can be downloaded from http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:MIDieeemm06 .\nSee also message 18008 of the independent LTspice users' group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LTspice where this method was originally presented by Frank Wiedmann.
* * For this example, add the following definitions to the plot.defs file:\n* A() is an auxiliary quantity.\n* Dd() corresponds to D.\n* Hinf() corresponds to H_infinity.\n* All other function names are equal to those of the corresponding quantities.\n \n.func A()    =  V(o)@2*(V(y)@1*I(Viy)@3-V(y)@3*I(Viy)@1)+V(o)@1\n+ *(V(y)@3*I(Viy)@2-V(y)@2*I(Viy)@3)+V(o)@3\n+ *(V(y)@2*I(Viy)@1-V(y)@1*I(Viy)@2)\n.func Dd()   =  V(y)@1*I(Viy)@3-V(y)@3*I(Viy)@1\n.func H()    =  V(o)@2\n.func Hinf() =  A()/Dd()\n.func T()    = 1/(1/Dd()-1)\n.func Dn()   = H()/A()\n.func Tn()   = 1/(Dn()-1)\n.func D0()   = 1-Dd()\n.func H0()   = (H()-A())/D0()
