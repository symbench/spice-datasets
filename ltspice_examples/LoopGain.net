* Elements added to \ncompute current gain\nGi=I(V3)/I(V4)
* Element added to \ncompute voltage gain\nGv=-V(x)/V(y)
* Here the open loop gain is determined from the closed loop system[1].\nThe voltage gain and current gain are independently measured in\ntwo circuits identical except for the elements inserted into\nthe loop to make the measurements.  Then the open loop gain\ncan be plotted by plotting the quantity:\n \n((I(V3)/I(V4))*(-V(x)/V(y))-1)/((I(V3)/I(V4))+(-V(x)/V(y))+2)\n \nAlternatively, you can add the lines\n.func Gi()=I(V3)/I(V4)\n.func Gv()=-V(x)/V(y)\n.func middlebrook(x,y) = (x*y-1)/(x+y+2)\nto your plot.defs file and then plot the quantity\nmiddlebrook(Gi(),Gv())
