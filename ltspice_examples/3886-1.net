* Please read the following notes carefully, since the model presents different user interface\nthan the real part does.\n \n(1) All PMBus communication and memory address related functions and pins are not modeled. \n \n(2) Changes to all parameter values during the simulation running will not be in effect, unless the\nsimulation is stopped and restarted. This is different from the operation of the part, which will\n respond to the commanded changes while running. \n \n(3) Share_clk is not modeled. The default time reference of LTspice is used as the common time \nbase for all time related parameters.\n \n(4) The following parameters can be defined, by right-clicking the symbol of LTC3887. Different \nnomenclature from the datasheet is adopted here. If any value of these parameters are set beyond \nthe scope discribed in the datasheet, the resulting simulation outcomes are not meaningful.\nMFR_Voff_Thres to PWM off has a 90ms to 300ms delay.  This delay is set to 0ms in the model.\nOutput OV and UV setpoints are defaulted to +/-10%.\n \n \n     VIN_ON & VIN_OFF -- in volts, set the unit start/stop input voltages;\n     Freq -- in Hz, sets switching frequency as one of values of 250K, 350K, \n                425K, 500K, 575K, 650K, 750K, 1000K. FREQ_CFG pin needs to float \n                (or short to VDD25), to make the value be in effect;\n     PHs_0 & PHs_1 -- in degree,  set phase angle related to SYNC signal. \n                Certain combinations are restricted as in datasheet. FREQ_CFG \n                pin needs to float (or short to VDD25), to make the value be in effect;\n     Ton0_delay & Ton0_rise; Ton1_delay & Ton1_rise -- in sec, set delay and soft-start timers for \n                channel0 and channel1. Initialization time is not modeled;\n     Toff0_delay & Toff0_fall; Toff1_delay & Toff1_fall -- in sec, set delay and soft-off timers for \n                channel0 and channel1;\n     Vout_0 & Vout_1 -- in volt, set output voltages respectively;\n     Vout0_range & Vout1_range -- set maximum output range, with value 0\n                                                      14V; value 1 for 7V\n     Ilim0_range & Ilim1_range -- set maximum sensed peak current range, with value 0\n                           for low 50mV, and 1 for high 75mV;\n     OC_limit0 & OC_limit1 -- set ratio of peak current limit to the maximum value defined\n                      by Ilimit_range. It must be one of values: 0.5, 0.572, 0.642, \n                      0.714, 0.786, 0.858, 0.928, 1;\n     Mode_II -- sets light load operation mode: 0 for discontinuous, 2 for forced continuous;\n     Fault_response -- sets the response mode of the unit to occuring faults:\n                                 0 for ignore, 1 for latch up, 2 for Hiccup after Retry_delay time;\n     Retry_delay -- in sec, sets the timer before the unit turns on after a fault;\n     gm0, gm1 -- in A/V, sets the transconductance of the error amplifier\n     Rth0, Rth1 -- in ohms, sets the value of resistor in series with compensation \n                           capacitor on pin IthR0 (or IthR1)\n     MFR_Voff0_Thres, MFR_Voff1_Thres -- in V, sets threshold at which PWM\n                            is allowed to turn off
