# SPICE Netlists Datasets
This repository contains various sources of SPICE netlists for use as datasets for various machine learning tasks. Currently, this contains:
- [LTspice demo circuits](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator/lt-spice-demo-circuits.html)
- LTspice example circuits
- KiCad circuits scraped from GitHub. Scripts used to generate this data can be found [here](https://github.com/symbench/spice-dataset-utilities).


## Disclaimer
Copyright belongs to the original owner of the works (such as LTSpice for the demo and example datasets). The kicad_github dataset was scraped from public GitHub repositories and then converted to Spice using KiCAD and finally deduplicated.
