* Notes:\n  In this application, Vout1, Vout2 and Vout3 will start up with coincident tracking. If you want to disable this function, \n  please remove the voltage dividers at TK/SS1 and TK/SS2 pins, and add ceramic capacitors.\n \n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2011 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
