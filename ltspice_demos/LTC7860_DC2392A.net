* LTC7860 - High Efficiency Switching Surge Stopper\nHigh Voltage, High Efficiency Switching Surge Stopper with Timer\nInput: 7V to 100V     Output: 7V to 34Vmax @ 10A     Fsw = 350kHz
* Notes:\nSS & TMR capacitors have been reduced to speed up simulation time. Typical values should be .1uF & 22uF, respectively.\nIf the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\nIt remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\nComponent substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\nContact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\nCopyright © 2017 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
