* LTM4637 - 20A DC/DC µModule Step-Down Regulator\nHigh Efficiency 20A µModule Buck Regulator\nInput: 4.5V to 20V     Output: 1.2V @ 20A, Fsw = 520kHz
* Notes:\n  A smaller TRACK/SS capacitor is being used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 0.1µF.\n  More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and output voltage requirements.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
