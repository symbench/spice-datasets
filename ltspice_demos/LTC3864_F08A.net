* LTC3864 - 60V Low Iq Step-Down DC/DC Controller with 100% Duty Cycle Capability\n5V Output Automotive Step-Down Converter\nInput: 5.2V to 55V     Output: 5V @ 2A, Fsw = 350KHz\nVout follows Vin when 3.5V <= Vin <= 5.2V
* Notes:\n  A smaller SS capacitor (C7) is being used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
