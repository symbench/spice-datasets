* LT3975 - 42V 2.5A 2MHz Step-Down Switching Regulator with 2.7µA Quiescent Current\n3.3V Step-Down Converter\nInput: 4.3V to 42V       Output: 3.3V @ 2.5A
* Note:\n  A smaller value SS capacitor is used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 10nF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
