* LTC3788-1 - 2-Phase, Dual Output Synchronous Boost Controller\nHigh Efficiency Dual 12V/24V Boost Converter with Rsense Current Sensing\nInput: 4.5V to 24V (2.5V Min After Startup)      Output: 24V @ 5A & 12V @ 10A (Reduced if Vin<8V)
* Notes:\n  SS capacitors have been reduced to speed up simulation time. Typical values should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
