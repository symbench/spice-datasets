* -5.2V Rail
* This is SPICE simulation of the wide input voltage range (2V to 20V) positive to negative converter.\nInput: 2 -20V       Output: -5.2V @ 1A
* Synchronous buck controller LTC3835-1 U1 employed for actual Positive to Negative conversion and monolithic boost LT3580 used for biasing U1 at low voltages.
* Notes:\n  The softstart caps have been reduced by a factor of 10 in the interest of shortening simulation time.\n \n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2010 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
