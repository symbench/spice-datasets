* LTC3816 - Single-Phase Wide VIN Range DC/DC Controller for Intel IMVP-6/IMVP-6.5 CPUs\nInput: 12V, Output: 0.9V @25A, Rdroop: 2.1mohm, Fswitch = 400kHz
* Notes:\n1. Small value are used for TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time.\n    The typical value for actual applications will vary from 1nF to 100nF.\n2. More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and \n    output voltage requirements.\n3. This design example is for Intel Core Duo porcessor.\n4. If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n    It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n    Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n    Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts\n    Copyright © 2010 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
