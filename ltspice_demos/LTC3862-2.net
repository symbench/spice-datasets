* LTC3862-2 - Multi-Phase Current Mode Step-Up DC/DC Controller\nAutomotive High Output Voltage Boost Converter\n(The major advantage of LTC3862-2 is its ability to function at low voltages and drive standard level MOSFETs.)\nInput: 5V to 28V     Output: 75V @ 1A
* Notes: \n  A smaller SS capacitor, C3, is being used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc.  All rights reserved.
* OPTIONAL:  Low power LTC3803-5 booster provides 10V for biasing \nLTC3862 when input voltage drops during cold cranking.
