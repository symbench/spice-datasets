* LT8609B - 42V, 2A Synchronous Step-Down Regulator with 2.5uA Quiescent Current\n2MHz Low EMI High Voltage Synchronous Buck Regulator\nInput: 5.5V to 42V       Output: 5V @ 2A, Fsw = 2MHz
* Note:\n  Lower current pin-to-pin compatible solutions are available in the MSOP-10 package.\n  Smaller values are used for TK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time. See datasheet for typical values.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts\n  Copyright © 2017 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
