* LTC7860 - High Efficiency Switching Surge Stopper\nHigh Voltage Surge Suppressor with Timer\nInput: 3.5V to 60V     Output: 3.5V to 17V @ 5A     Fsw = 535kHz
* Notes:\n  Not included in simulation are the input capacitors, sense cap and gate protection diodes.\n  Smaller values are used for SS & TMR capacitors to reduce simulation time. See datasheet and demo manual for typical values.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts\n  Copyright © 2015 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
