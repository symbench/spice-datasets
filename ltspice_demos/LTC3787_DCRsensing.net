* LTC3787 - PolyPhase Synchronous Boost Controller\nHigh Current 2-Phase Synchronous Boost Converter with Inductor DCR Sensing\nInput: 7V to 16V     Output: 12V @ 18A
* L1, L2: Wurth 7443630140\nCIN1, Cout1 4x22uF/25V\nCIN2, Cout2, Cout3 25HVH270M\nC15 is 0.1uF

* This simulation demonstrates LTC3787 functionality in two modes of operation: 'regular' boost converter, when input voltage of 8V steps-up to 12V, \nand 'wire' mode, when Vin>12V. In the 'wire' mode circuit provides maximum efficiency by permanently keeping Q1 and Q3 in the 'on' state \nand by utilizing DCR sensing. Initial input voltage of 8V increased to 14V at  0.4 ms of the simulation time.
* Notes:\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
