* LTC6992 - TimerBlox: Voltage-Controlled Pulse Width Modulator\nPWM Oscillator Synchronizer\nFrequency of the slaves are adjusted so that all three PWM oscillators are synchronized to go high at the same time, independent of duty cycle\nTo force a frequency error, the Bi current sources add or subtract a set current error (+/-3% of master set current)
