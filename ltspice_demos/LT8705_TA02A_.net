* LT8705 - 80V Vin and Vout Synchronous 4-Switch Buck- Boost DC/DC Controller\nBi-Directional Buck-Boost Supercapacitor Backup Supply\nInput: 36V to 80V       Output: SCAPs 15V @ 1A, Load Holdup 8V @ 4A
* Note:\n  A smaller SS capacitor, C7, and SCAPS are being used to reduce simulation time. Typical SS capacitor value should be 1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
