* LT8611 - 42V, 2.5A Synchronous Step-Down Regulator with Current Sense and 2.5µA Quiescent Current\n-3.3V Negative Converter with 1A Output Current Limit\nInput: 3.8V to 42V      Output: -3.3V @ 1A
* Note:\n  A smaller value TR/SS capacitor is used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
