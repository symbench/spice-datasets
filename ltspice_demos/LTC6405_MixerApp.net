* LT5575 Direct Down \nConversion Mixer
* 890MHz LO
* 80MHz Sampling Clock
* LTC2249 14-bit ADC
* 900MHz RF\n-7dBm Input Power
* No voltage here because this is\nthe "virtual ground" for the LTC6405
* 2Vpp to drive the ADC
* Normally, would tie\nVocm to the VCM\nof the ADC
* A simple RC filter to provide noise filtering\nand some isolation between ADC glitching\nand the op Amp.  For more stringent\n applications, more complex filters may be necessary
* Sample and parasitic capacitor/resistor values for model\nare taken directly from the LTC2249 datasheet
* Note:\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
* A simplified model\nof the LT5575
* LT6405 - 2.7GHz, 5V, Low Noise, Rail-to-Rail Input Differential Amplifier/Driver\nFully Differential ADC Driver with Simplified Mixer and ADC Models\nThis simulation demonstrates an application using a fully differential amplifier coupled with\nsimplified models of the LT5575, Direct Down Conversion Mixer, and the LTC2249\nMany non-idealities of the ADC are not modeled, such as quantization effects and clock feedthrough
