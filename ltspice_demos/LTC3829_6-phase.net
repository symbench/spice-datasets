* LTC3829 - 3-Phase, Single Output Synchronous Step-Down DC/DC Controller with Diffamp\nHigh Current 6-Phase Single Output Step-Down Regulator\nInput: 12V, Output: 1.5V @120A, Fswitch = 400kHz
* Note:\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.

* Notes:\n1. Small value are used for TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time.\n    The typical value for actual applications will vary from 10nF to 100nF.\n2. More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and \n    output voltage requirements.\n3. For AVP, change R9 to be 100ohm, and adjust R8 and R25 for desired Rdroop.  Redo the compensation if necessay.\n4. For nonlinear function, connect a resistor between Ifast pin and GND to set the tripping threshold.\n5. For stage shedding, connecting the Mode pin to INTVCC, and the threshold is ajusted through R16 and R33.
