* LT3478-1 - 4.5A Monolithic LED Drivers with True Color PWM Dimming\nAutomotive TFT LCD Backlight Boost LED Driver\nInput: 8V to 16V     Output: 15W, 6 LEDs at 700mA
* Note:\n  A smaller value SS capacitor (C3) is used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
