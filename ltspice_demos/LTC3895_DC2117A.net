* LTC3895 - 150V Low IQ, Synchronous Step-Down DC/DC Controller\nHigh Efficiency High Voltage Buck Converter\nInput: 14V to 130V     Output: 12V @ 5.0A, Fsw = 150kHz
* Notes:\n  This device has the ability to adjust gate drive voltage from 5V to 10V with no required external boost diodes.\n  The output voltage can be set as low as 0.8V to as high as 60V, with certain modifications.\n  SS capacitors have been reduced to speed up simulation time. Typical values should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2017 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
