* LTM4641 - 38V, 10A DC/DC µModule Regulator with Advanced Input and Load Protection\n10A Step-Down µModule Regulator with Input and Output OVP\nInput: 4.5V to 38V     Output: 1V ±1.5% @ 10A, Fsw = 320kHz
* Note:\n  Small value is used for the TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 3.3nF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
