* Load
* LTC4446 - High Voltage High Side / Low Side N-Channel MOSFET Driver\nFast Turn-On/Turn-Off DC Switch\nInput: 0V to 100V\nThis High-Side Driver can be used to switch loads or between input sources at very high speeds and with no duty cycle limitations
* Notes:\n  C3 (3.3nF) is optional but may be required with high impedance loads (charge pump needs current return path).\n  D5 is required for inductive loads.\n  D6 (1N4148) is optional for fast on.\n \n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
