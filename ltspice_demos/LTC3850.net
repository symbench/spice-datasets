* LTC3850 synchronous step-down DC/DC converter\nInput: 12V   Outputs: 2.5V @ 10A and 1.2V @ 10A, Fswitch = 500kHz
* Notes:\n1. Small value are used for TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time.\n    The typical value for actual applications will vary from 10nF to 100nF.\n2. More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and \n    output voltage requirements.
