* LTC6258 - 1.3MHz, 20?A Power Efficient Rail-to-Rail I/O \nLED Driver With Self-Oscillation
* Note:\n  VC is biased lower when the LED is on, and biased higher when the LED is off, in order to kick start the oscillation.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
