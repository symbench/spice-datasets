* LT3751 - Capacitor Charger Controller with Regulation\nInput: 24V   Output: 300V
* Note:\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2010 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
* Scale charge time by the output capacitance\nused in the practical circuit.  For simulation, a 3.3uF\ncap is used to reduce simulation time.
