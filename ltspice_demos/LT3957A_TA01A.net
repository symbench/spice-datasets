* LT3957A - Boost, Flyback, SEPIC and Inverting Converter with 5A, 40V Switch\nHigh Efficiency Output Boost Converter\nInput: 4.5V to 16V       Output: 24V @ 600mA
* Note:\n  A smaller SS capacitor is being used to reduce simulation time. Typical values should be 0.33µF; see datasheet.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
