* LTC3890-3 - 60V Low IQ, Dual, 2-Phase Synchronous Step-Down DC/DC Controller\nLTC4000 - High Voltage High Current Controller for Battery Charging and Power Management\n60V Input DC/DC Power Supply with Battery Backup\nInput: 18V to 60V     Output: 3.3V @ 2A, Fsw = 200kHz, Vfloat = 14.4V
* BATTERY
* Notes:\n  When the input is present one half of the LTC3890-3 functions as battery charger and second half as DC/DC converter.\n  When input is disconnected, then battery supplies DC/DC converter and load.\n  LTC4000 controls LTC3890-3 through Ith pin during the charging process. \n  SS capacitors have been reduced to speed up simulation time. Typical values should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2015 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
