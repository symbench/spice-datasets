* LT3959 - Wide Input Voltage Range Boost/SEPIC/Inverting Converter with 6A, 40V Switch\nWide Input Voltage Range Boost Converter\nInput: 2V to 10V       Output: 12V @ .5A to 2A ( 0.5A @ 2Vin, 1.0A @ 5Vin, 2.0A @ 9Vin)
* Note:\n  To reduce simulation time, a smaller SS capacitor (C2) was used. Typical value should be .33µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
