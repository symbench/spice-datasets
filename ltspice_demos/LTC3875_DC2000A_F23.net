* LTC3875 - Dual, 2-Phase, Synchronous Controller with Low Value DCR Sensing and Temperature Compensation\nHigh Efficiency Dual Output Step-Down Converter with Ultralow DCR Sensing and Fast Transient\nInput: 4.5V to 14V     Outputs: 1V @ 30A & 1.5V @ 30A, Fswitch = 400kHz
* Note:\n  Small value are used for TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time. The typical value for actual applications will vary from 10nF to 100nF.\n  More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and output voltage requirements.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts\n  Copyright © 2014 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
