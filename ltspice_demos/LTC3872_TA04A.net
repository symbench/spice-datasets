* LTC3872 - No Rsense Current Mode Boost DC/DC Controller\nHigh Efficiency 5V Input, 24V Output Boost Converter\n Input: 3V to 9.8V  Output: 24V @ 1A
* Note:\n  A smaller RUN/SS capacitors is being used to reduce simulation time. The typical value should be 0.068µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
