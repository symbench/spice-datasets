* LTC3866 - Current Mode Synchronous Controller for Sub Milliohm DCR Sensing\nHigh Efficiency, 1.5V/30A Step-Down Converter with Very Low DCR Sensing\nInput: 4.5V to 20V     Output: 1.5V @ 30A, Fsw = 400kHz
* Note:\n  Small value are used for TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time. Typical value will vary from 10nF to 100nF.\n  More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and output voltage requirements.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
