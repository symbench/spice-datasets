* LTC3838 - Dual, Fast, Accurate Step-Down DC/DC Controller with Differential Output Sensing\nWide Input Range, High Efficiency Step-Down DC/DC Converter with Rsense Current Sensing\nInput: 4.5V to 26V     Outputs: 1.2V @ 15A & 1.5V @ 15A, Fsw = 300kHz
* Notes:\n  Small value is used for the TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time. Typical values will vary from 10nF to 100nF.\n  More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and output voltage requirements.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
