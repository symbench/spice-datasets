* LTC3805 - Adjustable Frequency Current Mode Flyback DC/DC Controller\nNonisolated Telecom Flyback Converter\nInput: 36V to 72V     Output: 5V @ 2A (Fsw: 200kHz)
* Note:\n  To reduce simulation time a smaller value for the SS capacitor has been used; please refer to the datasheet for typical values.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
