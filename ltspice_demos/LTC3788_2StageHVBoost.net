* LTC3788-1 - 2-Phase, Dual Output Synchronous Boost Controller\nLTC4440-5 - High Speed, High Voltage, High Side Gate Driver\nTwo-Stage High Voltage Boost Converter\nInput: 3V to 36V      Output: 140V @ 1A (Iout is reduced for Vin < 10V) , Fsw = 350kHz
* Notes:\n  SS capacitors have been reduced to speed up simulation time. Typical values should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
