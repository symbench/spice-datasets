* LTC3703-5 - 60V Synchronous Switching Regulator Controller\nHigh Efficiency High Voltage Step-Down Converter\nInput: 6V to 60V     Output: 5 @ 5A
* Notes:\n   C3 is reduced in value to speed up the simulation and illustrate current protection.  An appropirate value would be .1µ\n \n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
