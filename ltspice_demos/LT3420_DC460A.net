* LT3420 - Photoflash Capacitor Chargers with Automatic Refresh\nHigh Charge Rate Strobe Capacitor Charger\nInput: 2.5V to 6V     Output: 320V
* Note:\n  DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE OPERATION BY HIGH VOLTAGE TRAINED PERSONNEL ONLY\n  Scale charge time by the Cload capacitance. For simulation, a .1uF capacitor is used to reduce simulation time.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2017 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
