* LTC3785 - 10V, High Efficiency, Synchronous, No Rsense, Buck-Boost Controller\n10W Li-Ion/9V Wall Adapter Buck-Boost Controller\nInput: 2.7V to 10V     Output: 3.3V @ 3A, Fsw = 500kHz
* Note:\n  Component substitutions have been made based on available component models and parasitics are not modeled\n  A smaller value SS capacitor (C1) is used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 2.2nF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
