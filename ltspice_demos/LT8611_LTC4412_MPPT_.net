* Photovoltaic Equivalent Circuit\nVoc=11V, Vmp=9V, Isc=0.2A, \nImp=0.18A, Pmp=1.6W
* µP Controlled AD5245 Digital Potentiometer
* Note:\n  Smaller input capacitor, C6, is being used to decrease simulation time. See datasheet for typical values.\n  The AD5245 digital potentiometer is modeled as a voltage dependent variable resistor.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
