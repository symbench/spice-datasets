* LT8705 - 80V Vin and Vout Synchronous 4-Switch Buck- Boost DC/DC Controller\nTelecom Voltage Stabilizer\nInput: 36V to 80V       Output: 48V @ 5A
* Note:\n  A smaller SS capacitor, C11, is being used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
