* LTC3855 - Dual, Multiphase Synchronous DC/DC Controller with Differential Remote Sense\nInput: 4.5V-14V     Outputs: 1.8V @ 17A and 1.2V @ 17A, Fsw = 400kHz
* 1.8V @ 17A
* 1.2V @ 17A
* Notes:\n   In the actual application, a 100 Ohm / 1nF Rsense filter may be required instead of 10 Ohm / 1nF to counter\n   effects of Rsense ESL.  Refer to the datasheet for details.\n \n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2011 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
