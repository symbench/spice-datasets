* 2.5V @ 10A
* 1.2V @ 10A
* LTC3728 synchronous step-down DC/DC converter\nInput 12V   Outputs: 2.5V @ 10A and 1.2V @ 10A, Fswitch = 400kHz
* Notes:\n1. Small value used for RUN/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time.\n    The typical value for actual applications is 0.1u.\n2. More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and \n    output voltage requirements.
