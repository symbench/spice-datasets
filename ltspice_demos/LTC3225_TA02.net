* Notes:\n  To emulate the supercapacitor charging process within acceptable time interval, the capcitance is scaled down from its real value.\n  Super capcitor initial condition can be given to mimic the specific residual voltage at the beginning of the charging.\n \n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
