* Notes: \n  This circuit demonstrates LTC3862-2 ability to work over a wide input voltage range in automotive SEPIC application (DC1891). \n  In this simulation Vin drops to 6V and then rises to 20V; replicating cold cranking and load dump in automotive voltage bus.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc.  All rights reserved.
