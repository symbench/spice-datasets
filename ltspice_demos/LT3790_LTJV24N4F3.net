* LT3790 - 60V Synchronous 4-Switch Buck-Boost Controller\n240W High Efficiency Parallel Buck-Boost Regulator\nInput: 8V to 56V     Output: 12V @ 10A* \n*25A for Vin > 20V & R11/R26 = 4m Ohms
* Notes:\n  A smaller SS capacitor, C1/C12, is being used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 33nF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2015 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
