* LT3845 - High Voltage Synchronous Current Mode Step-Down Controller with Adjustable Operating Frequency\nHigh Voltage Telecom Step-Down Regulator\nInput: 20V to 55V           Output: 12V @ 6.25A
* Note:\n  A smaller value Css capacitor is used to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be 1500pF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
