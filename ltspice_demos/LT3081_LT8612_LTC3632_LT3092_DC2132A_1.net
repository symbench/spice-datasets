* Note:\n  Details description of this circuit is available in July 2014 edition of LT Journal of Analog Inovation.\n  A smaller RUN/SS capacitors on the LT8612 is being used to reduce simulation time. The typical value should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2015 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
