* LTC1625 - No Rsense Current Mode Synchronous Step-Down Switching Regulator\nHigh Efficiency Step-Down Converter\nInput: 5V to 28V      Output: 3.3V @ 4.5A
* Notes:\n  RUN/SS capacitor has been reduced to speed up simulation time. Typical values should be 0.1µF.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
