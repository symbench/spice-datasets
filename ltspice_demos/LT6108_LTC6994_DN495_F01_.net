* LT6108 - High Side Current Sense Amplifier with Reference and Comparator & LTC6994 - TimerBlox: Delay Block/ Debouncer\nEnergy-Tripped Circuit Breaker with Automatic Delayed Retry  \nInput: 5V to 80V   Threshold: 500mA (Time Interval Varies with Load Current) with a 2.5s Retry Delay\n(More information is available in Design Note 495)
* Note:\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
* Rload is stepped to show how \nbreaker time interval varies \nwith load current; higher \ncurrents trips the circuit \nbreaker in less time
