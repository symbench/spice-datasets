* LTC1541 - µPower Op Amp, Comparator and Reference\nLTC6994-1 - TimerBlox: Delay Block/ Debouncer\nHigh Accuracy, µPower, Over-Voltage Detector with Glitch Suppressor
* Out low on OV conditions\nthat lasts more than \nfalling edge delay
* Falling Edge Delay
* Inverter
* Over-Voltage Condition\nVin (R1+R2)/(R1+R2+R3) > Vref\nVref = 1.2V ±1%, SO8 package\nR1, R2 & R3 0.1% 50ppm
* The R4, R5 & R6 set the delay of the LTC6994-1.\nRefer to the LTC6994-1 data sheet.
* Note:\n  The Vsupply of LTC1541 and LTC6994-1 can be Vin or any voltage source 2.5V - 5.5V.\n  The accuracy of the circuit depends on the LTC1541 variations of the Vref, Vtrip, Vhysteresis and Vos voltages.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
