* LTC3626 - 20V, 2.5A Synchronous Monolithic Step-Down Regulator with Current & Temp Monitoring\n2.5V, 1MHz Step-Down with Average Input Current Limit & Monitor\nInput: 3.6V to 20V (475mA Average Limit)       Output: 2.5V @ 2.5A
* Note:\n  IMONin capacitor (C7) should be 1µF to provide adequate loop statility; it was decreased to speed up simulation of the input current limit.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
