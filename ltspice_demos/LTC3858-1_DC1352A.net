* LTC3858-1 - Low IQ, Dual Output, Synchronous Buck Controller\nInput: 4.5V to 36V, Output1: 3.3V @ 5A, Output2: 8.5V @ 3A
* Notes:\n \n  C2, C5 should be 0.1µF, not 0.001µF.  It is reduced in value here to speed up the time to simulate a soft start cycle.\n \n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2011 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
