* LTC3854 - Small Footprint, Wide Vin Range Synchronous Step-Down DC/DC Controller\nSmall Footprint Step-Down DC-DC Converter\nInput: 4.5V to 14V     Output: 1.5V @ 15A, Fsw = 400kHz
* Notes:\n  Small value is used for the RUN/SS capacitor to reduce simulation time. Typical value should be .1µF.\n  More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and output voltage requirements.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2012 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
