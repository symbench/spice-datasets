* There is higher noise without\n balanced input resistance\ndue to increased gain and mismatch

* LTC6404-1 - 600MHz, Low Noise, High Precision Fully Differential Input/Output Amplifier/Driver \nImpedance Matching & Noise Measurements for Fully Differential Amplifiers\nThis simulation demonstrates the effect of input resistance mismatch on circuit output noise\nMore information on noise calculations is available in the LTC6404 datasheet
* The resistor is stepped from a balanced case (i.e. the \nparallel combination of 50 and 80.6 ohms) to an unba-\nlanced case (tied to ground)  The noise plots show that\nthis change can significantly affect the output noise\n \nThe balanced case is shown on the green trace and the\nunbalanced case is shown on the blue trace
