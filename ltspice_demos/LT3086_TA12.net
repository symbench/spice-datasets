* LT3086  - 40V, 2.1A Low Dropout Adjustable Linear Regulator with Monitoring and Cable Drop Compensation\nAdjustable Voltage Controlled Current Source\nInput: 3V to 12V    Output: 0A to 2.1A constant current
* Note:\n  Restrict input voltage range to limit power dissipation and prevent foldback current limit from interfering with proper operation\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2015 Linear Technology Inc. All rights reserved.
* Track adjust from \n0V to 750mV for \n0A to 2.1A constant current
