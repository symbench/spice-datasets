* Notes:\n 1. Small value are used for TRACK/SS capacitors to reduce simulation time.\n     The typical value for actual applications will vary from 10nF to 100nF.\n 2. More output capacitors may be needed to meet load step and \n     output voltage requirements.\n 3. For AVP, change R8 to be 100ohm, and adjust R9 for desired Rdroop.  Redo the compensation if necessary.\n 4. For stage shedding, connecting the Mode pin to INTVCC, and the threshold is ajusted through R15.\n 5. If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n    It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n    Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n    Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
