* LTC3731CUH- Three-phase high efficiency DC/DC converter\nInput: 12V     Output: 1.5V, Component value selected based on DC558 demo circuit
* Note:\n RUN/SS caps is reduced to speed up simulation speed signficantly.\n More output caps might be needed to meet certain load transient requirement.
* 1.5V@30A
* Note:\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance.
