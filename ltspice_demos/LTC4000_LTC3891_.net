* LTC4000 - High Voltage High Current Controller for Battery Charging and Power Management\nLTC3891 - Low IQ, 60V Synchronous Step-Down Controller\nHigh Voltage High Current Step-Down Converter, Power Path Controller & Li-Ion Battery Charger\nInput: 24V - 60V     Output: 16.8V @ 6.0A; including 4.0A charging current, with 0.4A C/X Termination
* LTC4100 details:\n  1. Charges battery packs by programmed charge current (R5, R7).\n  2. Provides input voltage to external load (Rload).\n  3. Terminates charging cycle as charging current is reduced to preset value (R12).\n  4. Limits input current if it exceeds preset value (R6).
