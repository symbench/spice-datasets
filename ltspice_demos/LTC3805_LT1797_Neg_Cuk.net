* LTC3805-5 - Adjustable Frequency Current Mode Flyback/ Boost/SEPIC DC/DC Controller\nLT1797 - 10MHz, Rail-to-Rail Input and Output Op Amp\nPositive-to-Negative Cuk Converter\nInput: 8V to 16V     Output: -12V @ 3A
* Notes: \n  V2 is being used to enables converter for 2ms and then shuts it down.\n  LT1797 is being used as a differential amplifier for sensing negative voltage; allowing reference control signals to use ground.\n  If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release" command from the "Tools" menu.\n  It remains the customer's responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the actual application.\n  Component substitution and printed circuit board layout may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability.\n  Contact your local sales representative for assistance. This circuit is distributed to customers only for use with LTC parts.\n  Copyright © 2013 Linear Technology Inc.  All rights reserved.
